                <h3>My codding journey...</h3>
                <p>
                    I think I started just like a lot of people. I grew up playing video games with my brothers and we always wanted to make or own games.
                    Just with that on mind, we all ended up doing completely different things. <br> One of my first experiences with programing was buying
                    and using my first 3D printer. I was facinated with all you can do with some simple instructions given to the machine. After that a was 
                    able to build my first own computer. Working with the terminal just for fun made things even more interesting so i wanted to give it
                    a try to everything software related.

                <h3>My first program</h3>
                <p>Back to December of 2022, I was working in a place like a warehouse. I had to paste shipping labels into packages to latter be shipped, the
                    rest of the time I was sittimg on a computer updating the state of the packages that we were receiving. <br>
                    We had to enter into a site to look for those packages and then update the state of each one, one by one, to received. That was the most boring
                    activify I ever did on my life, then I was delighted with the idea to make a program that could do that automaticly for me. <br>
                    I started a course online on how to use <span>Python</span> and about two months later, I made my first program capable of doing what I wanted.
